### Topic: dark matter simulation mapping to full hydrodynamic similution 

### Goal: estimate cosmological parameters (number of galaxies, dark matter mass, etc.) from dark matter simulation.

### Data: Simulations from Illustris Project

### Code Usage see notebook **Train.ipynb** for training models, and **Prediction_PowerSpec.ipynb** for generating prediction and evaluating
